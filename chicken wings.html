    <h2>Homemade Chicken Wings</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken ribs are the chicken equivalent of pork ribs and beef ribs. I call them “the better wings” because you get all the tasty slippery/juicy meat qualities of wings with a higher meat-to-bone ratio. Plus, they’re more economical.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken Breast</li>
      <li>Skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs and chicken legs</li>
      <li>Cauliflower florets</li>
      <li>Fish and prawns/shrimp </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Garlic Butter –</strong> Mix the melted butter and minced garlic together. I use a garlic crusher – easy and makes the garlic “pasty” which is ideal for blending into butter. If you don’t have a garlic press, finely mince with a knife, or if you want to really impress me, smear it into a paste with the side of your knife!
      </li>
      <li><strong>Creole Seasoning - </strong>Mix all the spices, salt, pepper and sugar in a bowl. It looks like a lot, thanks to the sugar. We want a lot – so we can thoroughly coat all the wings!</li>
      <li><strong>Toss - </strong>Here’s the order in which I toss the wings for the most even coating: half the seasoning, toss, remaining seasoning, toss, garlic butter, toss. The seasoning is everything. Nobody wants to land the wing that’s not properly coated with the spice mix!</li>
      <li><strong>Bake -</strong>Spread the wings out on a lined tray large enough so they are in a single layer with a bit of space between them (as pictured). If they are more crowded, then the tray juices may stay watery rather than reducing. 

Bake for 45 minutes (small wings) to 50 minutes (regular /large wings, pictured) until golden, basting at the 30 minute and 40 minute mark. The wings are baked at 200°C/390°F (180°C fan-forced). A little higher than usual, to get good colour on them. Colour = flavour!</li>
      <li><strong>Basting - </strong>To baste, squidge a brush into the tray juices and generously brush / dab onto the surface of the wings. This is key for getting really good flavour on the wings, so baste generously!</li>
      <li><strong>Serve - </strong> Once the wings are done (45 – 50 minutes), give them one last baste (this is the most important one because the tray juices should be caramelised by now). Pile into a bowl or on a plate, then pour all the tray juices over. Sprinkle with something green if you’re feeling fancy (coriander/cilantro, parsley or green onion) then dig in!</li>
    </ol>

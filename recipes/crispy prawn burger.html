    <h2>Homemade Crispy Prawn Burgers</h2>
    <p>
      Good prawn burgers are weirdly hard to come by. The ones I’ve tried have either been disturbingly bouncy (like over-firm Thai fish cakes), dry from overcooking, or just plain lacking in prawn flavour (I suspect….fillers!).

This homemade version fixes all that. I also like that it’s a great prawn recipe where it doesn’t really matter whether the prawns have been freshly plucked out of the ocean, or came in frozen bags from the grocery store. Freshly peeled prawns have a softer, juicier texture which is really noticeable in dishes like Garlic Prawns, whereas in prawn burgers, the difference is not as stark!

    <h2>Ingredients for the crunchy crumbed PRAWN PATTIES</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Prawns (Shrimp)</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Green Onion</li>
      <li>Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>Egg and flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients for the BURGER</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Soft buns</li>
      <li>Lettuce</li>
      <li>Gherkins</li>
      <li>Tartare sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Chop –</strong> the prawns up into small pieces, just under 1cm / 0.2″.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Blitz - </strong>half the prawns using a stick blender with garlic until it becomes pasty. No need to be super meticulous about ensuring every little bit is blitzed, because we stir in prawn chunks anyway.</li>
      <li><strong>Prawn patty mixture - </strong>Scrape the prawn paste into a bowl and mix by hand with the remaining chopped prawns, green onion, salt and pepper.</li>
      <li><strong>Form balls -</strong>Using slightly wet hands to prevent the mixture from sticking, roll the mixture into 4 balls.</li>
      <li><strong>Flour- </strong>Working one ball at a time, coat in flour and shake off excess. Note: The mixture is quite soft so I find it’s easier for handling to do the dredging steps in ball form then press into pattiy shapes at the end.</li>
      <li><strong>Egg - </strong> Then roll in the egg, and allow the excess to drip off.</li>
    </ol>
